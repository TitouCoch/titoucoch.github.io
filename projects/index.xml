      <description>Sport-Track, web application that will revolutionize amateur sports Created to facilitate the management of sports teams, the application will help thousands of licensed players throughout the country to access useful information such as the training session and game schedules but also statistics and messages from the team and staff. For messaging we used a web socket to make it dynamic. We used the ratchet library which allows instantiating a web socket server.</description>

      <description>Encoding information into a bar code and Scanner : In this project I developed an encoder to encode an amateur sportsmanâ€™s license in bar code form. After studying the different bar codes that exist and I chose to create a bar code in height and not in width. Especially inspired by the spotify code.
For encoding : I start with information that is a string of ten characters which includes uppercase letters, miniscule letters and numbers .</description>

      <description>Apply multiple algorithms on graphs Grap : The graph is composed of the 465 bus stop GPS coordinates of the BAB (Biaritz, Anglet, Bayonne) region in France Development I have developed a graph traversal application using Python and the libraries Tkinter and Graphics. The application applies various well-known algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, and Bellman-Ford on a bus stop map. The application features a menu and a graphical map where the results can be observed.</description>
