      <description>Internship Experience as Software Developper During my 3-month internship at Athome Solution, a web application company based in Bordeaux , France. I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project involving web APIs.

In addition, I implemented continuous integration to ensure that each push or merge of code to the main branch of the project triggers API testing and generates test results.</description>
